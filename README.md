### Project Description
Guess the number was one of the first web games I developed during the **Javascript and Web development course on Udemy**. The idea behind this porject is to get my hands in the water and gain practical experience on how web development works. Developing games can exponentially become challenging. Luckily, **guess the number game** was challenging enough for my skills back then. I learnt a lot about DOM manipulation and JS methods. I learnt that there could be tons of ways to achieve the same outcome. However, knowing how to solve a problem is simply not enough on an enterprise level, it is more about choosing the optimal solution for a particular problem without compromising the integerity of the project.
